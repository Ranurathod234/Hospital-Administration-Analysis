## 🧠 Project Description

This project focuses on **analyzing hospital readmission patterns** to enhance patient care and reduce costs. We used data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) to build a **risk-based stratification model**, identify the **clinical and demographic factors** influencing readmissions, and provide **evidence-based recommendations** for hospital leadership.

Key steps included:
- Cleaning and transforming encounter data
- Risk scoring based on medication, ER visits, and chronic conditions
- Segmenting patients into **High**, **Moderate**, and **Low** risk groups
- Creating Power BI dashboards for real-time stakeholder insights

### 📈 Highlights:
- **46.2% readmission rate** among 66,590 encounters  
- Highest burden in **Internal Medicine** and **Emergency** departments
- Majority of high-risk patients aged **60–80**
- Top contributors: polypharmacy, ER use, diabetes

Through this analysis, the hospital can:
- Improve discharge planning
- Implement targeted follow-ups
- Allocate departmental resources effectively
